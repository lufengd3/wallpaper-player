## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a potential security threat, vulnerability or exploit in Tauri
or one of its upstream dependencies, please DON’T create a pull-request, DON’T
file an issue on GitHub, DON’T mention it on Discord and DON’T create a forum thread.

We will be adding contact information to this page very soon.

At the current time we do not have the financial ability to reward bounties, 
but in extreme cases will at our discretion consider a reward.
